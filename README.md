This is a two player blackjack game created by Arnav Bhatia!

Rules:
Players are dealt a starting hand of 2 cards with the hopes of getting to the magical number of 21, or to get as close to 21 as possible. If a player gets 21 on his initial hand, it is called a "blackjack" or a "natural". The player wins, unless the house reaches blackjack as well. The other ways to win are to hold a higher sum of cards at the end of the play than the house, or to have the house go over 21.
